#  Case Project 2-4: Social Networking Assessment

##  Summary: What I Learned About Personal Cyber Risks and Defenses

After reviewing my Instagram settings, I found several ways to improve my accountâ€™s security. I enabled **two-factor authentication** to protect against unauthorized logins and made sure my account is set to **private** so only approved followers can see my posts. I also reviewed my **follower list** and removed accounts I didnâ€™t recognize or interact with. To limit exposure, I **disabled location tagging** and **restricted who can comment or message me**. These changes help ensure that my content and personal information are only accessible to people I trust, reducing the risk of unwanted attention or data misuse.

##  Artifacts

Here are screenshots from my hands-on project and case study:
- Turning on Two-factor Authentication on (I can't believe this wasn't already on!)

## ðŸ’­ Reflection: How My Personal Practices Will Change

This project helped me connect cybersecurity concepts to my everyday habits. Moving forward, Iâ€™ll:

- Use strong, unique passwords and a password manager  
- Enable MFA on all accounts that support it  
- Regularly audit my social media settings and follower lists  
- Avoid sharing location data unless absolutely necessary  
- Be more mindful of who can interact with my content  

Cybersecurity isnâ€™t just technical, itâ€™s personal. These small changes help protect my identity, relationships, and reputation online.
