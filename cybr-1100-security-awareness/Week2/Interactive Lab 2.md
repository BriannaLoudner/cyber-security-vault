#  Interactive Lab 2: Password Cracking Reflection

##  What I Did
In this lab, I used CrackStation to test how quickly different passwords could be cracked using hash values. I experimented with a mix of simple and slightly complex passwords to see how they held up.

##  Key Takeaways

- **Speed matters**: CrackStation cracked most passwords in under a second.
- **Weak passwords are easy targets**: Even slightly complex ones like `7DaYs2die` were cracked quickly.
- **Hashing isnâ€™t enough**: Without added protections like salting, weak passwords are vulnerable.

##  What This Means

Password-cracking tools are incredibly fast and effective, especially against predictable or reused passwords. This lab reinforced the importance of using strong, unique passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) to stay secure.

##  Personal Action Steps

- Continue improving my password habits.
- Avoid dictionary-based or pattern-based passwords.
- Enable MFA across all accounts.
- Share these insights in my portfolio to help others understand real-world risks.
