##  Section 1: What I Learned  
This week’s module helped me understand how everyday habits like reusing passwords can open the door to serious cyber threats. I’ve reused passwords across multiple accounts for years, mostly because it felt easier to remember them. But now I see how that convenience creates a major vulnerability. Module 2 explained how attackers use **credential stuffing** to exploit reused passwords, and how **botnets** automate these attacks across platforms. That was a wake-up call. I also learned about **privilege escalation**, where attackers gain deeper access once they’re inside a system. Another part that stood out was how **social engineering**, like phishing, plays into these attacks — especially when people are tricked into revealing login info. The module emphasized that cybersecurity isn’t just about tech tools; it’s about understanding how attackers think and how small habits can either protect or expose us. I’m starting to see how all these pieces connect.

##  Section 2: How I’ll Apply It  
I’m actively working on breaking my password reuse habit by switching to a password manager and creating strong, unique passwords for each account. I’m also enabling **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever I can to add an extra layer of security. Beyond that, I’m being more cautious with emails and links, especially when something feels off — even if it looks legit. I want to build habits that make me harder to target, and I’m thinking more critically about how I share information online. This module gave me the push I needed to take real steps toward protecting my digital life.

##  Section 3: Muddiest Point  
I’m still a little unclear on how organizations actually detect credential stuffing in real time. I get the concept, but I’d like to understand more about the tools they use to monitor login attempts and flag suspicious patterns. I’m also curious about how password managers themselves stay secure — like what protects them from being compromised. These are areas I want to dig into more as I continue learning.
