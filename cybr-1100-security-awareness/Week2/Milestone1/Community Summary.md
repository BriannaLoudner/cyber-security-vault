# Service Learning Project Summary

**Organization:** Nelsonville Community Health Alliance (NCHA)  
**Type:** Local nonprofit focused on rural healthcare access and patient advocacy

The Nelsonville Community Health Alliance is a small nonprofit serving southeastern Ohio, dedicated to improving healthcare access and digital literacy for underserved populations. As they adopt electronic health records and telehealth platforms, cybersecurity becomes essential, not just for protecting patient data, but for maintaining trust in their services.

Security awareness is especially important for NCHA because many of their staff and patients are unfamiliar with digital threats like phishing, weak passwords, and unsafe browsing. A single breach could compromise sensitive health information and disrupt care coordination. By helping the organization build basic cybersecurity habits, I can support both their mission and their long-term resilience.

To tailor training materials to their needs, I’ll use clear language, relatable examples, and photos to visualize key concepts, like spotting a phishing email or recognizing a secure login screen. I’ll also create printable checklists and handouts that staff can use during onboarding or community workshops. The goal is to make cybersecurity feel approachable, practical, and empowering for everyone involved.
