Service-Learning Project Summary

Organization: Hopewell Health Centers, Inc.

Type: Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) serving rural communities across southeastern Ohio

Hopewell Health Centers is a nonprofit healthcare provider offering medical, dental, and behavioral health services across multiple rural counties in southeastern Ohio. As a Federally Qualified Health Center, they serve diverse populations, including individuals with limited access to digital tools and cybersecurity education. With growing reliance on electronic health records (EHRs), patient portals, and telehealth platforms, cybersecurity awareness is critical to protecting patient data and maintaining trust in their services.

Security awareness is especially important for Hopewell because both staff and patients may be vulnerable to digital threats like phishing, weak passwords, and accidental data exposure. A single breach could compromise sensitive health information and disrupt care coordination across their network of clinics. By supporting basic cybersecurity habits, the organization can strengthen its digital resilience and better serve its community.
To tailor training materials to their needs, I’ll use clear, non-technical language and photos to visualize key concepts, such as identifying phishing emails, recognizing secure login screens, and practicing safe password habits. I’ll also create printable checklists and handouts that staff can use during onboarding or community outreach. These materials will focus on practical, everyday actions that build confidence and reduce risk. The goal is to make cybersecurity feel approachable, relevant, and empowering for both healthcare workers and the patients they support.
