# 🛡️ Case Project 6-5: Privacy Best Practices—Scoring What Works
For this project, I reviewed the privacy best practices outlined in the current module and scored each one twice: once for how strong the privacy protection is (1–5), and once for how likely I am to follow it (A–F). I also asked three friends to do the same. The results were revealing; some practices are powerful but hard to stick with, while others are easy wins.  
## 🔍 My Scores  

| Best Practice                          | Privacy Strength (1–5) | Likelihood to Follow (A–F) | Notes |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Use strong, unique passwords           | 5                       | A                           | I already do this consistently. |
| Enable two-factor authentication       | 5                       | A                           | I enable it on all accounts when possible. |
| Avoid public Wi-Fi without a VPN       | 4                       | B                           | I avoid public Wi-Fi entirely since I don’t use a VPN. |
| Regularly update apps and OS           | 4                       | A                           | My apps auto-update, so I’m always current. |
| Limit app permissions                  | 5                       | D                           | I struggle with this, but I’m working on it. |
| Use privacy-focused search engines     | 3                       | D                           | I default to Google out of habit. |

## 👥 Friends' Privacy Best Practice Scores

| Best Practice                          | Privacy Strength (1–5) | Emily (A–F) | Taylor (A–F) | Sylvester (A–F) | Notes |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Use strong, unique passwords           | 5                       | A            | A         | B            | All three use strong passwords regularly. |
| Enable two-factor authentication       | 5                       | B            | C         | D            | Emily uses it for key accounts; Taylor and Sylvester are less consistent. |
| Avoid public Wi-Fi without a VPN       | 4                       | C            | D         | D            | Emily is cautious; Taylor and Jordan use public Wi-Fi without much concern. |
| Regularly update apps and OS           | 4                       | A            | B         | C            | Taylor has auto-updates on; Emily updates manually; Sylvester forgets often. |
| Limit app permissions                  | 5                       | B            | D         | D            | Emily checks permissions; Taylor and Sylvester rarely do. |
| Use privacy-focused search engines     | 3                       | C            | D         | F            | Taylor has tried alternatives; Emily and Sylvester stick with Google. |  

## 👥 Friend Feedback Highlights  
- Emily gave high privacy scores but low likelihood grades, especially for VPN use and search engine switching.  
- Taylor was strong on password hygiene but didn’t know how to audit app permissions.  
- Sylvester was neutral across the board, saying, “I just go with defaults unless something breaks.”  

This confirmed what I suspected: people care about privacy, but convenience and habits often win.  
## 🧠 What I Learned
- Awareness ≠ Action. Even when people know what’s safer, they don’t always follow through.
- MAID and app permissions are underexplained. Most people don’t realize how much data apps collect.
- Small wins matter. Strong passwords and updates are easy to adopt and make a big difference

## ✍️ My Own Best Practices
1. *Reset your MAID monthly.*  
It’s easy to do and breaks advertiser tracking chains.  

2. *Use guest mode when sharing your phone.*  
 Keeps your data and settings private from others.  

3. *Run a quarterly privacy checkup.*  
Audit permissions, clear history, and review settings, like spring cleaning for your phone.
