# 🔏 Case Project 6-4: VPN Risks and Real Privacy  
VPNs promise privacy, but not all deliver. Because most VPN use TLS (Transport Layer Security), instead of true end-to-end encryption, the VPN provider can still see the websites you visit. If they log that data, they can leak it, sell it, or hand it over. That’s not privacy, that’s surveillance with a slick interface.
## ⛓️‍💥 VPNs That Broke Trust  
Several VPNs have compromised user security by storing and exposing data:  

**UFO VPN (2020):**  
- Claimed “no logs,” but leaked 1.2TB of user data: including IPs, browsing history, and plain-text passwords.

**PureVPN (2017):**  
- Helped the FBI identify a user by handing over logs, despite advertising a no-log policy.

**Hola VPN:**  
- Turned users into exit nodes and sold bandwidth, violating basic privacy expectations.

These cases show that “no logs” claims mean nothing without proof.

## 📝🔍 Terms of Service Deep Dive  
I reviewed the Terms of Service and Privacy Policies for three VPNs:  

### 1. ExpressVPN  
- **Claim:** No activity or connection logs.  
- **Verification:** Independent audits by PwC and Cure53 confirm no-log practices.

### 2. Mullvad  
- **Claim:** No personal data required, not even an email. No logs stored.  
- **Verification:** Open-source apps, regular audits, and a transparent warrant canary.

### 3. NordVPN  
- **Claim:** No logs of user activity or connection timestamps.  
- **Verification:** Multiple third-party audits (Deloitte, PwC) and RAM-only servers that wipe data on reboot.

## ✅ How Can You Verify?  
- Independent audits by reputable firms.  
- Open-source apps you can inspect.  
- Warrant canaries that signal government requests.  
- Transparency reports show how often data is requested and denied.

## 🤌 My Pick: Mullvad

Why Mullvad? It’s built for privacy from the ground up:

- No personal info required.  
- No logs, period.  
- Open source everything.  
- Audited and trusted by privacy advocates.

It’s not flashy, but it’s solid, like a privacy bunker with a Swedish accent
