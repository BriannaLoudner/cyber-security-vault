**Cybersecurity Playbook Entry**  
**Author:** Brianna  
**Focus:** Practical security rules, malware prevention tips, and group lab summary  
## 🔐 Top 5 Security Rules for All Users  
1. 	Think before you click – Avoid opening unexpected links or attachments, especially from unknown senders.
2. 	Use strong, unique passwords – Don’t reuse passwords across accounts; consider using a password manager.
3. 	Keep software updated – Install updates regularly to patch known vulnerabilities.
4. 	Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) – Adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a password.
5. 	Report suspicious activity – If something feels off, notify IT or security staff immediately.
## 🛡️ Malware Prevention Tips (Plain Language)
• 	Don’t trust pop-ups or downloads you didn’t ask for. If it looks sketchy, close it.  
• 	Back up your files regularly. If malware infects your system, backups help you recover without paying a ransom.  
• 	Install antivirus software and let it run. It’s like a security guard for your computer.  
## 📢 Awareness Month Lab Summary
As part of my deliverable for Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I created a one-slide mini poster titled **“Left 4 Clicked: One Link, Total Chaos.”** Inspired by survival-horror games, the poster uses a zombie-themed visual to highlight how social engineering attacks manipulate trust and urgency. It features five practical tips for spotting phishing and impersonation tactics, designed to be both engaging and beginner-friendly for healthcare staff.
