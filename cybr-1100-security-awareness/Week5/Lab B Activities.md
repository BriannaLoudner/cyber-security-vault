## 🌐 Google Search: My Name (`Brianna Loudner`)

When I searched my name online, here’s what came up:

- **Old YouTube Channel**  
  I found a channel under my name, but I no longer have access to it. It’s inactive and doesn’t show any content, just the default description.

- **Persuasive Speech Video**  
  My video titled *“Declawing Cats Should Be Banned”* still shows up in search results. I made it for a college speech course, and I still have access to it.

- **Facebook Listing**  
  My name and profile photo appear in public Facebook search results, grouped with similar names like Brianna Louder and Brianna Ladner.

> 🔍 This highlights how even old accounts and school projects can stick around online. Knowing what’s out there helps me stay in control of my digital footprint.  
## 🏛️ Absurd Laws: Nelsonville & Ohio

- **Nelsonville, OH**  
  No officially documented absurd laws in the city code. Local ordinances are standard and practical, with no bizarre bans or outdated rules found.

- **Ohio (Statewide)**  
  It’s illegal to get a fish drunk.  
  This law is real and still on the books. While likely intended to prevent animal cruelty or strange fishing practices, it stands out as one of Ohio’s weirdest.
