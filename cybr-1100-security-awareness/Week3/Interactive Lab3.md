#  Week 3 Lab Report: Ransomware Analysis and Mitigation

##  Malware Type: Ransomware

**Definition:**  
Ransomware is a form of malicious software that encrypts files or locks systems, demanding payment (often in cryptocurrency) for restoration. It’s designed for financial extortion and commonly targets individuals, businesses, and healthcare systems where data access is critical.

##  Infection Method & Symptoms

**Infection Vectors:**
- Phishing emails with malicious attachments or links
- Drive-by downloads from compromised websites
- Exploitation of unpatched software vulnerabilities

**Common Symptoms:**
- Inaccessible or renamed files
- Ransom notes or lock screens
- System slowdown or full lockout
- Changed file extensions

##  Evidence from Lab Work

**Tools Explored:**
- [NoMoreRansom.org](https://www.nomoreransom.org): Reviewed prevention tips and tested the Crypto Sheriff tool for strain identification.
- [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com): Uploaded sample ransom notes to identify variants and locate decryption tools.
- **AlphaDecryptor Tool**: Explored its interface and detection process (no encrypted files available for full test).

##  Defenses & Mitigations

**Recommended Controls:**
1. **Regular Backups**  
   - Offline or cloud-based, encrypted, and routinely tested.

2. **Security Awareness Training**  
   - Phishing detection, email hygiene, and safe browsing practices—especially for healthcare staff.

3. **Endpoint Protection & Patch Management**  
   - Real-time antivirus tools and consistent software updates.

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   - Protects remote access and sensitive systems.

5. **Network Segmentation**  
   - Limits malware spread by isolating critical systems.

##  NetAcad Modules 2.1–2.2 Connection

Modules 2.1 and 2.2 emphasize malware behavior, threat vectors, and layered security strategies. This lab reinforced those concepts by applying them to real-world ransomware tools and scenarios. The overlap includes phishing awareness, endpoint protection, and the importance of proactive defense.
