# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Security Awareness
 
 #  In this module, I explored the core principles of cybersecurity, including key terminology, threat actor profiles, and basic defense strategies.

###  Key Concepts
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or harm. The **CIA triad**; Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability; is a foundational framework used to evaluate and maintain security.

###  Threat Actors
I learned about different types of threat actors, each with unique motives and skill levels:
- **Script Kiddies**: Use pre-made tools with limited technical knowledge
- **Hacktivists**: Driven by political or social causes
- **Insiders**: Authorized users who misuse their access
- **Nation-State Actors**: Highly skilled attackers backed by governments

Understanding these profiles helps organizations anticipate and respond to potential threats.

###  Defense Strategies
Cybersecurity relies on both technical tools and human awareness. Common strategies include:
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds layers of identity verification
- **Patch Management**: Regular updates to fix vulnerabilities
- **User Awareness Training**: Educates users to recognize phishing and social engineering tactics

Reflection:
  Understanding these concepts made me more aware of how everyday habits, like reusing passwords or ignoring software updates, can create serious risks. In the workplace, especially in fields that handle sensitive data like healthcare or finance, even small mistakes can lead to major breaches. This module helped me see cybersecurity as a shared responsibility, one that starts with individual awareness and extends to organizational policies and practices.
