# About Me – Week 1 Profile

**Name:** Brianna Loudner

**Career Interest:** Cybersecurity & Medical Informatics

Hi, I’m Brianna. I’m currently working toward my degree in medical informatics, and I’ve recently found myself drawn to cybersecurity, especially the human side of it. I care deeply about protecting sensitive health data and helping people understand how to stay safe online without feeling overwhelmed. For me, cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and encryption; it’s about making digital spaces safer and more accessible for everyone.

My academic background has given me a solid foundation in health IT systems, ethical data use, and structured communication. I’m building on that by learning how to detect phishing attempts, manage passwords securely, and use tools like GitHub Pages to organize my work. I’m also working on improving my public speaking and feedback skills so I can explain technical topics in ways that actually make sense to beginners.

Outside of school, I’m a mix of strategy and creativity. I love playing video games and crocheting; both give me space to think, problem-solve, and unwind. My favorite color is blue, which feels fitting: calm, clear, and trustworthy. That’s the kind of energy I try to bring into my work and learning.

Right now, my goal is to build a portfolio that reflects not just what I’ve learned, but how I’ve grown. I want it to be useful, authentic, and something I’d be proud to share. Long-term, I see myself working in healthcare IT or a cybersecurity role that focuses on training and awareness, helping others feel confident in protecting their data and making smart digital choices.

I know I’m still early in the journey, but I’m excited to keep learning, keep improving, and keep making cybersecurity feel a little less intimidating and a lot more human.
