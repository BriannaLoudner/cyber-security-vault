 Summery:
 Module 1 introduced the basics of cybersecurity and the growing threat landscape. I learned how attackers exploit system vulnerabilities and how personal habits, like strong passwords and cautious online behavior, play a critical role in protecting my own data.

Reflection:

  This week’s module emphasized how digital threats can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. I learned about the different types of cyber attackers and how vulnerabilities, whether in software or human behavior, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access. The module also highlighted how cybersecurity isn’t just a technical issue; it’s a critical part of how we protect personal information, financial assets, and even national infrastructure.
  
  Understanding these concepts made me more aware of how everyday habits, like reusing passwords or ignoring software updates, can create serious risks. In the workplace, especially in fields that handle sensitive data like healthcare or finance, even small mistakes can lead to major breaches. This module helped me see cybersecurity as a shared responsibility, one that starts with individual awareness and extends to organizational policies and practices.
