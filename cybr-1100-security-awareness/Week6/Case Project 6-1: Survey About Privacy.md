# Case Project: 6-1 Survey About Privacy Analysis

## 📱🔏 Smartphone Privacy: What My Friends Know (and don’t 🤯)

I ran a quick privacy check-in with three friends to see what they know about smartphone privacy. The results? A mix of solid instincts, fuzzy definitions, and some “wait, what’s a MAID?” moments. Here’s the breakdown.

### 🧠 What They Know

*Location Services:*

- Two out of three knew what location services were and how they work. One wasn’t sure. That’s 66.67% awareness, which is decent, but still leaves room for confusion about background tracking and app permissions.

*MAID (Mobile Advertising ID):*

- This one stumped them. One said, “I don’t know,” and another guessed it was “like a web browser but for a phone.” So yeah, MAID is still a mystery. That’s a red flag, since it’s central to how advertisers track users across apps.

*Surveillance-Based Advertisers:*

- Surprisingly, all three said yes, they’re aware. That’s 100% recognition, which shows that the concept is out there, even if the mechanics aren’t fully understood.

*School Monitoring:*

- Two said their school doesn’t monitor their smartphone activity. One wasn’t in school, but speculated that maybe her friend’s school does. So, either there’s no monitoring, or it’s happening quietly.

*Privacy Measures Taken:*

- All three use strong passwords. Two disable location services and use privacy-focused apps. One uses a VPN and clears browsing history. No one said, “none of the above,” which means everyone’s doing something, but not everything.

*Concern Level:*

- Most were neutral. One was “not very concerned.” No one said they were “very concerned.” That’s telling people know surveillance exists, but they’re not panicking about it.

### 🔍 What This Tells Me

- People are aware of surveillance but not always equipped to fight it.
- MAID is still flying under the radar, even though it’s a major privacy lever.
- Strong passwords are the default win, but deeper settings like app permissions and VPNs are hit-or-miss.
- Schools may not be monitoring phones directly, but the lack of clarity means students aren’t sure what’s being tracked.

### 📝 Next Steps for Outreach

*This survey shows a clear need for:*

- **MAID education:** what it is, how it works, and how to reset or limit it.
- **Permission walkthroughs:** how to audit app access to location, mic, and camera.
- **Privacy mindset shifts:** moving from “neutral” to “aware and empowered.”
